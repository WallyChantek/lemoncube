- Notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A Room is simply a collection of objects, including entities. By doing it this
  way, we can easily just add entities to a room by creating them without
  having to call a specific entity-collection function. We don't have to work
  our way through the Engine by doing this, either.
