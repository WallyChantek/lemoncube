I hereby permit you to (mostly) do whatever you want with this framework. Just
please adhere to a couple things:

1) Don't outright claim primary authorship of these files (don't be a jerk)
2) Leave this notice in if you use the library as a whole (you don't need to
   include it if you pull pieces or files from it, just if you include the
   entire package)

Like, that's it. Otherwise, I don't really care. You don't even need to put my
name in the credits or distribute this file with your game (outside of the
source files; in other words, please just leave it in the .love file in this
package/directory).

I don't care about who owns what code snippets and any other inanity like that.
That sort of mentality is why there are so many stupid lawsuits and other
nonsense in other artistic industries. Cool, we used the same chord progression
or color palette or collision-detection function or whatever. Who really cares?

In my mind, a piece of code is not much different than a key or scale or chord
in a song, or a shape or design concept in art (like a character having black
hair or a white shirt or whatever).

The constitution of the whole is what creates ownership and value. Just as we
are the sum of our experiences, the sum of those parts is what makes something
worthwhile: a song, a picture, a piece of software.
